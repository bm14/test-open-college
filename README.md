Hi Simon,

Thank you for the opportunity. 
1)I don't have photoshop, so I converted the psd file into jpeg. I didn't find any chevron icons, tick icon or the hat image that is shown beside the current course. I have sourced what I could from fontawesome and the internet. 
2)2) I wanted to attach an event listener so you can go through the cards but from the picture I didn't see a next button, so to see other cards just refresh the page. 
3)3) Also the about me section, i just used the enquiery end point from the json file.
